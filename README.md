# SimDemopolis

SimDemopolis[2][] is a simulation of Josiah Ober's hypothetical political system [_Demopolis_][], based on the principles of _direct democracy_, , written in Prolog by Jeremy Pitt in 2018[2][]. It simulates institution formation, social netowrk construction, voting, role assignment, and various other features, and can calculate various statistical measures. The original version can be found on [SourceForge][3][]. 

This version adds a Python interface for SimDemopolis, along with code that asses the degree to which civic participation takes place in the simulation, and plots various graphs.
